Hi Team,

I am writing this document in the hope that this project will expand and would require the team to
maintain it.

My plan on how to get this project up and running the development phase:
1. It must be on github repository. __Done__ ( consider private repository afterwards )\
2. It should be a maven build. ( To handle all the dependencies ).
3. Software rule: Cheap,Good,Faster rule , you can have only 2 out of these three.
